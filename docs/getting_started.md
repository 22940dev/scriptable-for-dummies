Though Scriptable has its own documentation, found here, it could be difficult to get started using their API. This guide will act to help with that.

#### This guide assumes the following:
* A good understanding of Javascript.
    - Some good references for Javascript can be found on w3schools or MDN web docs. Good beginner courses can be found on Codecademy or SoloLearn.
* Access to an iOS device.
* iOS 14 or later.

Further updates, announcements, or assisstance can be found on the unofficial Scriptable subreddit and Discord server.
