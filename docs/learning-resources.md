Scriptable uses Apples JavaScriptCore, which supports ECMAScript 6.
This page includes our recommendations for some of the best external resources available to learn Javascript.

Some guides and tutorials will assume that you're running JavaScript in a browser and therefore have access to browser specific objects, such as a document. **Scriptable does not run JavaScript in a browser and therefore such objects do not exist.**
