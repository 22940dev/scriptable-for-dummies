This page includes our recommendations for some of the best external resources available to learn Javascript.


### Learning Javascript
* [W3Schools' JavaScript Tutorial]((https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp)).
* [Intro to Programming in JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/programming-with-javascript)
* [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

:::caution

Some guides and tutorials will assume that you're running JavaScript in a browser and therefore have access to browser specific objects, such as a document. **Scriptable does not run JavaScript in a browser and therefore such objects do not exist.**
