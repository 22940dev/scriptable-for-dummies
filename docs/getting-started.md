Though Scriptable has its own documentation, found [here](https://docs.scriptable.app/), it could be difficult to get started using their API. This guide will act to help with that.

#### This guide assumes the following:
* A good understanding of Javascript.
    - Some good references for Javascript can be found on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp) or [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide). 
    - Good beginner courses can be found on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) or [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/JavaScript/?ref=app).
* Access to an iOS device.
* iOS 14 or later.
* You have the [Scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188) app or [Testflight beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/uN1vTqxk). 

Further updates, announcements, or assisstance can be found on the unofficial Scriptable [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/scriptable/) and [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fsguJthT).
